# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System, which demonstrates the implementation of login and registration functionalities with a focus on backend development. The backend leverages Node.js, Express.js, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, and Cookie-Parser for managing cookies. The application uses middlewares to ensure secure access to protected routes and user-specific functionalities.

## Features
### 1. User Authentication:
Secure login and registration using JWT.
Cookies are used to manage user sessions efficiently.
### 2. Role-Based Access Management:
Placeholder dashboard with future plans to manage roles, permissions, and activities.
### 3. Middleware:
Middleware for authenticating and authorizing user actions.
### 4. Frontend: 
Clean UI for login and registration forms, created with React and Tailwind CSS.
### 5. Scalable Backend:
Modular and easy-to-extend structure.

## Technologies Used
### Backend:
Node.js and Express.js: For building a robust and scalable server.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication and token-based session management.
Cookie-Parser: For handling cookies on the client-server interaction.
Middlewares: Custom middlewares to manage user authentication and role-based access.
### Frontend:
React.js: For building the login and registration forms.
Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive UI components.
### Development Tools:
Postman: For API testing.
Git and GitHub: For version control and project hosting.
